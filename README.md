# CMP202: Data Structures and Algorithms 2 

### Assessment Unit 1

> In this assessment, you will demonstrate your achievement of the following learning outcomes through a software project and video presentation:
> * Understand the emerging importance of parallel programming in modern software development, and experiment with the performance impact of parallelising parts of an application.
> * Describe a variety of application-specific algorithms (sorting/numerical/image processing) and associated data structures in common use, and discuss the benefits and limitations of parallelisation.
> * Be aware of the standard techniques of software performance measurement, including profiling, and apply these techniques to identify performance bottlenecks in real programs.

##### 1. Guidelines

> Your application must:
> * Implement a parallelised algorithm that solves a problem;
> * Make use of appropriate parallelisation strategies;
> * Quantify and reason about the (positive and/or negative) impact of your design choices.
> * **Be constructed so that you can vary the number of threads or thread groups being used and measure the application's performance in an appropriate way**

##### 2. My implementation
